# Learning TypeScript

## Context
I work with data & machine learning, mostly running experiments, building 1-week prototypes & ML systems (>1k queries/sec, <140ms). I know Python, Scala, SQL, and basic HTML/CSS.

To decide on what to learn in 2021, I ran two polls on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1343286184047300608) (400 votes) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eugeneyan_learning-programming-activity-6749056005809827840-0czR/) (200 votes). Based on the comments from friends in both polls, I decided that TypeScript (+ React) would be most fun and practical for me to pick up.
